# autoClicker
Very simple script that allows you to use your mouse 5 button to autoclick left mouse button. 
I made this for a game called Vermintide2. I hated the mashing of the mouse button. This script allows you to hold down
Mouse 5, which for me, is near my right thumb. I'm able to grab and hold the mouse while activating the autoclicker.
I find it gives me a lot more control during tense fights.

You'll need to install pynput
hold down mouse button 5 to make the auto clicker work
middle mouse click will exit out of the listener
